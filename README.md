# My Porfolio

This is my personal online portfolio.

## Getting Started

This online porfolio was helped launched by [Github](https://github.com/) also being able to use the Mac terminal to Git push documents from the software "Visual Studio Code 2"
- - - 
### Prerequisites

So of the items I used to make this website up and running
```
1. Github
2. Git bash / terminal
3. Visual Studio Code 
```

### Installing

These are the tools I used and how I used them.

The steps I took was:

```
I created a new repository in my Github account. After which I created the html file and the css file. I opened these files in the Visual Studio Code editor. From there I was able to structure both the files to my liking and then would do a git push command when ever changes where made.
```

I repeated this process finished.
